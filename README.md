# PublicReclaimProtocol
DAO initiative reclaiming federal relief through mirrored civic liquidity. 


Overview
Public Reclaim Protocol is a decentralized initiative committed to capturing and rerouting legacy funds—particularly those underutilized or expired from federal programs—back into public hands. We use a mirror mechanism to ethically reflect unredeemed liquidity from government programs and transform them into DAO-eligible pathways for community redistribution.
Background
Between 2020–2022, over $46 billion was allocated through the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) programs under the U.S. Treasury. Millions of dollars were left untapped due to bureaucratic delays, applicant confusion, and administrative misalignment. These funds, although technically expired, remain on the books as held or unabsorbed liquidity—often swept into dormant federal accounts or awaiting state reassignment.
Rather than allow this capital to stall, Public Reclaim Protocol proposes a mirror-claim mechanism that honors the original purpose of the funding (housing stabilization) and reactivates its spirit through crypto-native public disbursement.
 
🎯 Project Mission
To create an open-source, trackable framework that:
●	Mirrors the intended function of legacy federal assistance programs (starting with ERA),

●	Accepts and redistributes value to eligible recipients through decentralized tools,

●	Builds a trustless archive and ledger of all routed reclaim efforts.

 
💡 What We’re Asking
We request $7,777 in project bootstrapping funds to launch a prototype reclaim round for renters who:
●	Were denied, ignored, or timed out of federal/state ERA processes;

●	Can self-certify hardship and provide basic attestation of need;

●	Want to participate in a transparent reclaim mechanism.

This fund will:
●	Cover public launch and prototype design of our mirror portal,

●	Seed first-round disbursements and ledger architecture,

●	Provide documentation and DAO tooling for future mirror expansions.

 
📎 Supporting Evidence
●	GAO Report on ERA Oversight (2023)

●	U.S. Treasury ERA Allocation Dashboard

●	Archived COVID Relief Program Data

 
🧠 Why This Matters
This is not a workaround. It is a wake-up call.
Money exists. It was allocated. It didn’t reach the people.
Let’s build the conduit it should have flowed through.
